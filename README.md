# 32-bit ALU Design and Verification using Verilog HDL

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents the design and verification of a **32-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)** using **Verilog HDL** and **AMD Vivado 2026.1**.

The ALU is a combinational digital circuit that performs arithmetic, logical, shifting, and comparison operations on 32-bit binary operands.

The design was developed and verified using a Verilog testbench and Vivado Behavioral Simulation. The project also includes RTL analysis, synthesis, FPGA implementation, resource utilization analysis, timing analysis, power estimation, and DRC verification.

## 🧩 ALU Interface

### Inputs

| Signal | Width | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `A` | 32 bits | First operand |
| `B` | 32 bits | Second operand / shift amount source |
| `ALU_Sel` | 4 bits | Selects the required ALU operation |

### Output

| Signal | Width | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `Result` | 32 bits | Result of the selected operation |

## ⚙️ Supported ALU Operations

The operation is selected using the 4-bit `ALU_Sel` input.

| `ALU_Sel` | Operation | Function |
|---|---|---|
| `0000` | Addition | `A + B` |
| `0001` | Subtraction | `A - B` |
| `0010` | AND | `A & B` |
| `0011` | OR | `A \| B` |
| `0100` | XOR | `A ^ B` |
| `0101` | NOT | `~A` |
| `0110` | Shift Left | `A << B[4:0]` |
| `0111` | Shift Right | `A >> B[4:0]` |
| `1000` | Comparison | `1` when `A < B`, otherwise `0` |

## 🏗️ ALU Architecture

The ALU is implemented as combinational RTL using Verilog HDL.

Conceptually, the design consists of multiple arithmetic and logical operation blocks whose outputs are selected according to the `ALU_Sel` control signal.

The supported functions include:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- AND
- OR
- XOR
- NOT
- Logical left shift
- Logical right shift
- Comparison

The operation selection is implemented using combinational logic.

## 🧪 Functional Verification

A dedicated Verilog testbench was developed to verify the ALU functionality.

The testbench applies different combinations of:

- `A`
- `B`
- `ALU_Sel`

and observes the resulting `Result`.

The behavioral simulation tests all nine supported operations.

### Representative Test Cases

| Operation | Inputs | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|
| Addition | `10 + 5` | `15` (`0x0000000F`) |
| Subtraction | `10 - 5` | `5` (`0x00000005`) |
| AND | `0x0F & 0x03` | `0x00000003` |
| OR | `0x0F \| 0x03` | `0x0000000F` |
| XOR | `0x0F ^ 0x03` | `0x0000000C` |
| NOT | `~0x0000000F` | `0xFFFFFFF0` |
| Shift Left | `1 << 2` | `4` |
| Shift Right | `16 >> 2` | `4` |
| Comparison | `5 < 10` | `1` |

## 📊 Simulation

Behavioral simulation was performed using **Vivado Simulator**.

The supplied simulation waveform covers `ALU_Sel` values from `0` through `8` over a **90 ns simulation period**.

The main signals observed in the waveform are:

```text
A[31:0]
B[31:0]
ALU_Sel[3:0]
Result[31:0]
